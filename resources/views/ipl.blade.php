                        The auction will be held in 2 rounds: <br> <br>
                    <h4>Preliminary Peril</h4>
                    Quiz Round: This is a quizzing round based on the knowledge of cricket and previous editions of
                    IPL. It will be an elimination round and top 10 teams will be selected for the final round. The
                    quiz will consist of questions, of varying difficulty levels, depending upon the number of teams
                    participating. <br>

                    <h4>Online Auction Round</h4>
                    <h5>Bidding Round:</h5> If you like taking calculated risks, this competition is for you. The final
                    10
                    teams will compete in a live E-Auction of players. Each team will be given a fixed amount
                    (Digital Money worth 100 Crores) which will be used by them during the auction. The aim will be
                    to build a team that maximizes the total ratings of the players of the team in the limited
                    budget along with the constraints on the total number of players.

                    <h5>Team Selection:</h5> A team of 4 students will be formed. If someone wants to participate but doesn't
                    have a team, he/she can also fill the form. Later they will be grouped in teams of 4. <br>
                    *NOTE: Players of a Team can belong to different colleges/ institutes. <br>
                    1. No member can be a part of more than one team. Violation of this rule will lead to disqualification
                    of both the teams. <br>

                    5.A total of 6 players in the formed cricket team are allowed to be Non-Indian. <br>
